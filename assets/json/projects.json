    "body": "In this project I applied my knowledge of Model View Controller (MVC) Object Oriented programing paradigm \
              to make an animator. The animator works by providing it a text file with description of shape \
              and its animations. There is a single model with three different views \
              (SVG, Description in Human Readable Text and Java Swing Visual View). By building this program \
              I learned the importance well design programing to be able to \
              adapt code to new customer wants along with the importance of performance so the animation runs smoothly. I used \
              Java 8 Streams to speed up the animation process through multi-threaded programing.",

      used to make the cut outs of the plywood boards that the electrical \
      components were attached to. Further, I applied my soldering and \
      SolidWorks skills to aid in the completion of these bays. I \
      collaborated in a group setting to overcome engineering challenges such \
      as managing the constraints of space, ensuring the boards were secure, and \
